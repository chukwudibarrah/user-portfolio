# Your portfolio

I build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from your/user input.

## Description

* The application prompt users for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL.

* A HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts is constructed and written to the file system.

* The task was accomplished using:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system.

  * `inquirer` for collecting user input.

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system.

  * Promises for handling asynchronous behavior.
